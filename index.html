			<p id="mess" >Hey my baby. Happy freaking 19 birthday. its crazy to think that you are so freaking beautiful and still not even done with your glow up. so unbelievably hot. I hope that this is a good idea for a card espescialy since we are suffering from long distance. you are so freaking spescial to me and i could never ever trade what we have for anything ever. every moment has been spescial and even the bad ones helped us grow and become stronger in the end. we have so so so many incredible memories that it will be impossible to capture and show them all to you but i did manage to bring together a couple of my most fond memories and put them onto this website, and as time goes on i will add and update and maintain this website and make it bigger as our relationship growths further. you deserve this and so much more and i will do my very best to give it to you. i really hope that this birthday has been super duper amazing and you were spoilt like you desserve to be. i just wish i could have been with you to spoil you and cuddle you and kiss you and give you ALL the lovies. but for now heres a virtual kiss. ;3  i miss you so danm much my bun bun. and always remember that i love you the most</p>
